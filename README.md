# runefactory5_steamdeck_fix
this is a script that lets you install RF5Fix (higher resolution, the steam deck's 16:10 aspect ratio, better framerate, better draw distance, and all that good stuff) and a modified version of Kentun's controller fix with the DLC installer removed.

it's designed to be very easy to use. just run it, follow the prompts, and everything should be good!
